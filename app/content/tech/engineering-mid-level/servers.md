# Engineering Mid Level - The Server Layer


## Flask

[Code](#/content/tech/engineering-mid-level/servers/flask)

<!-- 
* Notes
  * Flask (and Python in general) has a very minimalist feel, the most so out of these servers
  * Certain features though like  JSON encoding I could have done a better job (with more time). The resulting JSON hack makes the minimalist gains questionable - I should eventually resolve this
  * Among the servers, this is the only one that needs setting of an environment variable (FLASK_APP) before it can be run
  * Sometimes when testing, the server does not shutdown from the command line. The googled answer to this is to create a 'shutdown' route. This should be turned off in production
  * Presence of `__pycache__/` everywhere
  * Routing and controllers are in one file, unlike the other servers
  * For static files, /static (flask, spring-boot) = /public (rails, laravel)
* Files
  * server.py
  * main.py
  * app/controllers/features_controller.py
  * app/models/features.py
