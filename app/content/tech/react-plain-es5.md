# React.js in Plain ES5

If you're a web developer, and you've been living under the sun this past few years, you most certainly have heard of [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/), a javascript framework from Facebook. Sitting at roughly ~70k stars (<iframe class='github' src='https://ghbtns.com/github-btn.html?user=facebook&repo=react&type=star&count=true' frameborder='0' scrolling='0'></iframe>), it is currently the [fourth](https://github.com/search?q=stars:%3E1&s=stars&type=Repositories) most starred project in all of Github, and is arguably right now the most popular pure javascript framework/library. [Google trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=react%20js) have "react js" as a search term increasing over time, and with [hundreds of companies](https://github.com/facebook/react/wiki/sites-using-react) using it in production, job searches have increasingly been looking for react js as an experience. Among the other trending javascript frameworks, vue.js is also growing, but have lots of catchup to do. For now, all signs point to React.js as the top dog of javascript frameworks/libraries, taking the throne in a similar manner as jQuery a decade ago.

* [Top] React.js is now the top javascript framework for webapp
   * sitting at 68K stars
   * people who are using it https://github.com/facebook/react/wiki/sites-using-react
* [Start] Starting with react .. jsx, es6 classes, ..
* [Plain] Contrary to top google searches on react, you can simply start just by 
  grabbing the cdn of react and react dom, then using plain es5 onwards - no jsx, no classes.
  This requires an understanding of how javascript (and react work)
  * Start with
    * react component -> call and prototype
    * jsx -> h = React.createElement;
* [Why] why might you want to do this?
  * Some use cases might be contrived, but in my last major project, I was in charge
    of a joomla website that needed lots of custom coding. Contrary to some popular belief,
    cmss still can need a lot of help when dealing with highly granulazed requirements.
  * I decided to use react for templating and binding certain actions to data, but I can't have
    a very good workflow in the absence of an ftp - I was not given this privilege - merely using 
    whatever file editor the joomla has.

```javascript

h = React.createElement;

var _module = function(name) {
  React.Component.call(this, name);
  this.state = {input: ''};
  this.boot();
}
var prototype = {
  boot: function() {
  },
  render: function() {
    var _this = this;
    var template = h('div', {}, 'HAHA',
      h('ul', {},
        h('li', {}, 'More')
      ),
      h('form', {},
        h('input', {onChange: function(e){_this.handleChange(e)}, value: this.state.input }),
        h('button', {onClick: function(e){_this.handleClear(e)}, type: 'button'}, 'Clear')
      )
    )
    return template;
  },
  handleChange: function(e) {
    this.setState({ input: e.target.value})
  },
  handleClear: function() {
    console.log(this.state)
    this.setState({ input: '' })
  },
};
for (var i in prototype)                 _module.prototype[i] = prototype[i];
for (var i in React.Component.prototype) _module.prototype[i] = React.Component.prototype[i];

ReactDOM.render(h(_module), document.getElementById('content'))
