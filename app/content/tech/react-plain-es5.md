* [Top] React.js is now the top javascript framework for webapp
   * sitting at 68K stars
   * people who are using it https://github.com/facebook/react/wiki/sites-using-react
* [Start] Starting with react .. jsx, es6 classes, ..
* [Plain] Contrary to top google searches on react, you can simply start just by 
  grabbing the cdn of react and react dom, then using plain es5 onwards - no jsx, no classes.
  This requires an understanding of how javascript (and react work)
  * Start with
    * react component -> call and prototype
    * jsx -> h = React.createElement;
* [Why] why might you want to do this?
  * Some use cases might be contrived, but in my last major project, I was in charge
    of a joomla website that needed lots of custom coding. Contrary to some popular belief,
    cmss still can need a lot of help when dealing with highly granulazed requirements.
  * I decided to use react for templating and binding certain actions to data, but I can't have
    a very good workflow in the absence of an ftp - I was not given this privilege - merely using 
    whatever file editor the joomla has.
