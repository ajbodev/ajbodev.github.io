# Engineering Mid Level

Perusing thru available jobs in StackOverflow, I came across this [gem](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/109401/full-stack-software-engineer-britecore). What's so special about it? There are lots and lots of fullstack software engineering job postings out there - this is the only I've come across so far that gave you a 'guaranteed interview' if you complete a [special project](https://github.com/IntuitiveWebSolutions/EngineeringMidLevel) from them. I'm not really sure if it's guaranteed (I guess I'll have to find out), but the idea of having candidates prove themselves with a project - I think that's meritocracy at it's finest. And that's a good thing, because merit should be the most important basis in doing software right. Add to that, a good challenge like this reminds of my CS college days, when MEs (machine exercises) were regularly given after a lecture, and finishing them was such a reward in itself. Sometimes there's competition who can finish them the fastest, or the least amount of code. And sometimes they were too hard and we didn't finish them, and that was alright - take em home, pound your head on the problem, then submit them the next day. 

Now, [this](https://github.com/IntuitiveWebSolutions/EngineeringMidLevel) particular problem, [this](https://github.com/IntuitiveWebSolutions/EngineeringMidLevel) gem - it's an ME alright, an Enterprise-style ME.

I've been job hunting the past few weeks, having just completed a big project with an oil company - all remote. I like remote - I feel my productivity is maximized compared to my non-remote former jobs (no commute, very quiet home office environment). Your mileage may vary, of course. If I have to relocate though to maximize my value (rather than productivity) with the company, I should be fine with that too, as I've done both.

By now most job hunting developers should know that their favorite Question and Answer website, StackOverflow, is also a job posting website, and a legitimate one at that. It's one of those organic, peripheral things that happen when developers congregate, and people realize that the resulting attention sphere is good for job hunters and job recruiters alike. Unlike traditional job hunting from indeed, StackOverflow feels like
