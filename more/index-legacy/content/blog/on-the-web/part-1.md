# On The Web

<!-- An exercise in thinking richly -->

I recently had a chat with some people in their older years about the web, the internet, and all these 'new stuff' that comes out of it. Older people and new technologies usually don't go very well together, so you can tell how this conversation will go. Long story short, a lot of skepticism was expressed about how 'beneficial' this internet stuff is. Emphasized also was the potential 'harm', related to privacy, control, and now we have more problems! And there's the romanticization of the good ol days where mail was written in paper, entertainment was thru radio waves in the air, yeah, you know how they did it in those days. Oh, and I happen to mention on a side that computers are now stronger than humans at the Go board game - they're not just taking our jobs, but our fun!

As a web developer, I explained the 'great' benefits that being interconnected brings ..

I admit though that I sometimes feel overwhelmed by just how encompassing the web is ..

The World Wide Web, which nowadays we simply call the 'Web', is a recent invention. The idea behind the 'Web' can be argued to be as old record keeping itself. How's that? Let's call this an execise in thinking richly.

..

Oh, is any of these relevant to my work as a web developer building another React Redux app, bundled with Webpack, styled with SASS + BEM + CSS Modules, code linted with ESLint, tested via Jasmine, deployed and version controlled with Git, all automated by NPM scripts (or Yarn), don't forget left-pad? I'm not sure. It's cool to think about, though.

  * it sometimes feel like we've never seen anything like it
  * and yet that's not the case
  * while the web, as in www, is a recent invention, it's possible to argue that the idea of the web itself is as old as man has kept records
  * now that's something bold, but let's imagine for a moment a flat-earther
    * any debate can be argued to a stalemate provided there are no limits to reason.
  * I'm going to argue likewise and say that
