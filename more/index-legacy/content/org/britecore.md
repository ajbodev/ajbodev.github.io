* tech -> biz
  * By default, programmers care about technology first, and business second
  * But programmers are part of a bigger community - the one that pays them
  * Their work is an important part of the value chain 
  * 
  * It's not default for a programmer to think of the business first more than the tech
  * A few programmers are business-savvy, but 
  * 
  * We progammers are in the organizations we work for because of our understanding of technology.

* Adders ("level 1", 0.0 to 1.4) who can solve most programming problems, given enough time. These tend to be the ones who do line-of-business work, write scripts to fetch data and answer questions that executives or traders care about, etc. The good ones want to progress beyond this level, remove themselves from parochial details and work on more general "core" problems.
* Multipliers ("level 2"; 1.5 to 2.4) who can select technologies, make architectural decisions, and write or maintain useful libraries. They tend to have open-source contributions to their name, speak at conferences, and are often executive-equivalent in importance to their companies.
* Global Multipliers ("level 3"; 2.5+) who build communities, create platforms and come up with concepts like Google's MapReduce. Their ambitions tend to out-scope most companies so they're often in academia, consulting independently, or highly paid in large firms' R&D labs.
