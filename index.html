I was not disappointed. If you have a child or know someone in college who is trying to figure out what to do with their life, or even if you're north of fifty and still wonder what you'll be when you grow up, then this book is for you. So Good They Can't Ignore You, is so good that you shouldn't ignore it.\n\nThe central premise that sets this book apart from so much life advice that is out on the market is that following your passion is terrible advice. There are two main reasons for this: first, very few people at a young age know enough about life to choose something to be really passionate about, and even if they do, they are bound to be wrong. If Steve Jobs had followed his early passion, maybe he would have made a dent in the universe as a Buddhist monk.\n\nSecond, while most people would love to have a job that allows them to be creative, make an impact on the world, and have control over how they choose to spend their time, jobs like that are rare and valuable, and the only way to get something valuable is to offer something in return. And the only way to be in a position to do that is to master a difficult skill. Passion doesn't waive the laws of economics, and if it's not difficult it won't be rare. The book cites the example of Julia, who quit a secure job in advertising to pursue her passion of teaching yoga. Armed with a 4-week course, she quit her job, began teaching, and one year later was on food stamps. Here's a hint: if a four-week course is enough to allow you to set up shop, do you think you might have a little competition?\n\nTaking the economic model a step further, the book argues that you must develop career capital, which comprises skills, relationships and a body of work. The long and arduous process of building your capital also opens up your options and refines your own understanding of what you really like to do and what you can be good at.\n\nNewport offers the craftsman mindset in place of the passion mindset. The passion mindset asks what the world can offer you in terms of fulfillment and fun; the craftsman mindset forces you to look inside and ask what you can offer the world. You have to create value to get value, and that takes time and deliberate practice. It's the only way to get so good that they can't ignore you. The nice benefit is that rather than being good at something because you love it, you love doing something because you've gotten good at it. (Note the similarity to Carol Dweck's growth mindset.)\n\nWhat's the little idea? Another idea that Newport challenges is the common advice that you should have a big idea--set a big hairy audacious goal for your life and then work backward from it. The master plan approach certainly works for some people, but how many people do you know who have actually lived their lives that way? Instead, you should work forward from where you are, taking small steps that expand your capabilities and build up your career capital. In this way, more options and possibilities open up. Newport compares career discoveries to scientific discoveries, most of which occur in what's called the \"adjacent possible\", or just on the other side of the cutting edge of current knowledge.\n\nThe book is well-written. Newport emulates Malcolm Gladwell's technique of telling individual stories to illustrate the main point in each chapter. In addition, the arc of the stories follows a master story thread through the book, so that you feel like you are brought along on his quest to figure it all out.\nHere comes the part I did not like about the book, and I would not devote so much space to it if the author were not an MIT PhD, just beginning his career as an assistant professor of computer science.\n\nThe methodology in the book is suspect in two ways. While its stories are the book's great strength, the plural of anecdote is not data, and it's surprising how little hard data we're given. I certainly buy in because it makes sense and it matches my own life experience, but someone with a more skeptical point of view may be a tougher sell.\n\nIn at least one case, where he does use a peer-reviewed study for support, he overstates the case. Citing a paper by Amy Wrzesniewski, he states that the happiest, most passionate employees are not those who followed their passion into a position, but those who stayed around long enough to be good at what they do. If you read the actual paper, you won't find that conclusion, and in fact the author stresses that the sample size of 24 is too small to draw any firm conclusions.\n\nThat said, I strongly recommend this book to just about anyone, regardless of where you are in your career.\n\n\n\n\n-->\n";</script>

Creative, innovative, inspiring, generally positive people solving problems that matter, or those that a lot of users <a href=\"#/content/play/disruptive-innovation\">didn&#39;t know they had</a>. </p>\n<p>I started reading more about startups in reddit, online books. In my sightseeing, I came across this message from one &#39;guru&#39; (Sam Altman) that somehow hit me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The CEO doesn’t get to make excuses</strong>. Lots of bad and unfair things are going to happen. But don’t let yourself say, and certainly not to the team, “if only we had more money” or “if only we had another engineer”. Either figure out a way to make that happen, or figure out what to do without it. <strong>People who let themselves make a lot of excuses usually fail in general, and startup CEOs who do it almost always fail</strong>. Let yourself feel upset at the injustice for 1 minute, and then realize that it’s up to you to figure out a solution. Strive for people to say “X just somehow always gets things done” when talking about you</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I&#39;m not a CEO, and neither have I worked in a startup, but I&#39;ve known and worked with people who were in the upper management, and this quote felt all too familiar. </p>\n<p>If the programmers screw up, and don&#39;t deliver, it won&#39;t usually be them who will answer to the higher ups, but the executive responsible for managing them. He could lose his job, and of course, the programmers could lose their jobs. So what excuse does the managing exec make? He hired the wrong people? Yeah, that can work, but he still has to make the project work. Many a time, from the point of view of upper mgmt, make it work no excuses, or you&#39;re fired.</p>\n<p>And the programmers, what excuses do they make? They&#39;re lazy, not smart, or just not good? Whatever excuses they may have, the fundamental nature of the problems they&#39;re solving are <em>mostly</em> technical. <strong>Objective, reliable ways of resolving the problem are <em>there</em></strong>, and most of the time it only needs searching. </p>\n<p>Search, best practices, expertise - these are most of what you need to succeed in programming, <strong>but mostly search</strong>. The way I see it, if you&#39;re a programmer, there ought to be little excuse why you can&#39;t be bothered to do search. Programming, at least for the majority of business cases, is mostly a search process. A lot of people can do that!</p>\n<p>Thankfully, we delivered on the project. But I can&#39;t ever forget how the executive continually reminded us that his head is on the line if this project doesn&#39;t pan out. And as we know, most of the time, there really is no reason for a project not to pan out if it&#39;s widely understood that the solution is mostly technical. Most of such difficulties are resolvable by simply searching (sometimes, just googling stackoverflow). Of course, you&#39;d be surprised how many bad programmers there are. Not saying I was perfect, but scarcity of skills in a team (if there was even one) meant that sometimes programmers have to wear several hats.</p>\n<p>In many ways, programmers have it easy compared to executives. They should have a workable mastery of the technical, logical parts of the problem, which are mostly tame by comparison to the more social, political aspects that execs deals with. Beside, coding is fun. And <a href=\"#/content/play/make-coding-great-again\">great</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>So programmers, there are almost NO excuses - get it done</strong>.</p>\n<hr>\n<!--\n\nNow, I'm not a CEO (yet?), and neither am I aiming for any inkling of upper management at this relatively young point of my life, but this quote left a mark. I guess \n\nI have worked with vice presidents of two major healthcare companies back in the Philippines, and I've seen their headaches. They don't get to build software for the employees (that's my job), so if I screw up, these people will also screw up to the higher ups (why is this project taking too long, why is not working ..). I could get fired, and that will be their excuse\n\n// Bible HTML\n// RCX\n// Googling stackoverflow\n\n-->\n";</script>

As you can tell, I like web technology, especially the frontend. Lots of exciting changes are happening in that area, and young me likes exploring and pushing the boundaries. I even think <a href=\"#/content/play/make-coding-great-again\">coding can be great again</a>. </p>\n<p>I can do the backend equally well, and I don&#39;t know a reason why you can&#39;t if you&#39;re already a good frontend programmer. Like, it&#39;s just programming all the way down anyways, with some interesting changes in environment. And nowadays anyway, RESTful architecture somewhat abstracts whatever server framework you choose - server agnosticism should be default for frontend heavy projects.</p>\n<p>So yes, I like working in the fast changing world of the frontend. Far more exciting and challenging, especially since this is the layer that directly touches the UX. New standards in HTML (web components, ..), CSS (variables, grids, ..), JS (async/await, true parallelism, static typing, ..) and others (Web assembly, browser extension standards, ..) should keep people hopeful for the best .. the golden age of the web browser.</p>\n<p>Some people wrote about the quality of my webdev work. You can check them out <a href=\"#/content/referrals\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Oh, and before I forget, I dislike <a href=\"#/content/excuses\">excuses</a>.</p>\n<!--\n\n* **Likes**\n\n  * [Quotes](#/content/quotes)\n\n  * [Frontend](#/content/frontend) ([HTML](#/content/html), [CSS](#/content/css), [JS](#/content/js))\n\n  * [C#](#/content/) ([ASP.NET 4.6.1](#/content/), [ASP.NET Core](#/content/))\n\n  * [Java](#/content/) ([Spring Boot](#/content/))\n\n  * [PHP](#/content/) ([Laravel](#/content/), [Symfony](#/content/))\n\n  * [Node](#/content/) ([Express](#/content/), [Gulp](#/content/), [Webpack](#/content/))\n\n  * [Ruby](#/content/) ([Rails](#/content/), ofc)\n\n  * [Python](#/content/) ([Flask](#/content/))\n\n  * Databases ([MySQL](#/content/), [PostgreSQL](#/content/), [Mongodb](#/content/))\n\n  * [More](#/content/) (..)\n\n* **Dislikes**\n\n  * [Excuses](#/content/excuses)\n\nI'm OJ Abesamis, a web developer capable of [fullstack](#/notes/fullstack) development ([frontend](#/notes/frontend) and [backend](#/notes/backend)).
